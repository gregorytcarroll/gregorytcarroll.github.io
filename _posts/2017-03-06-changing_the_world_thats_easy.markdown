*“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” - Steve Jobs*

Changing the world. Not a small task. To be honest, its a humongous task which to one person may seem impossible. So, what about if we treat it like everything else? For example, I need to get to work at 7am every day. Do I ever think this just happens with the click of my fingers and the task is done? No. Instead, I break it down. I need to wake up at 4:45am at the latest in order to account for enough time for a shower and then some breakfast, eventually leading to me catching the 5:10am train. This then leads to me getting the 6:19 tube train at West Ham and an arrival at Green Park Station at around 6:40. I then walk at a leisurely pace to work and arrive 5 mins early. 

One task. Get to work at 7am. All I did was break it into a series of smaller tasks; smaller dominoes that fall perfectly until into place until the beautiful picture I've made is visible from a birds eye view. Granted, life is never perfect. My train could be late, my alarm might not go off, I hit snooze too many times etc. However, I take that day in my stride and place it amongst the many mistakes and curveballs life will hurl at me. And I move on - the most important thing is to move on. 

*"And why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up." - Thomas Wayne*

Essentially, What I'm trying to say is, changing the world is not a question of possibility or impossibility but rather a notion of whether you truly believe it is achievable and how you will achieve it. Honestly, I believe that technology is the path that needs to be taken in order to change this planet. Then again, others may have different ideas; but its those unique ideas that allow humanity to constantly evolve and add to the progression of our species. One pebble from everyone thrown into the lake will create a bigger ripple throughout the world in comparison to one guy (or girl) throwing a one rather large rock.



**MORAL OF THE STORY: No task is too big when broken down to be smaller.**
